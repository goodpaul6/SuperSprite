SuperSprite
===========

## Controls and Notes: ##

- This is an unfinished project, but it should be in working order for the most part.
- You can access the animation and import menus by moving your mouse to the left or right of the panel that contains the options.
- Holding CTRL and left or right clicking on a pixel in the canvas will copy that pixels colour to primary or secondary active colour.
- Holding ALT and left clicking on a pixel will delete it. (Turn it transparent)



## Export and Import locations. ##

All files are stored in %appdata%. To access this simply type "%appdata%" without the quotes into your start bar search. (Windows).

- Exported files are located at:
>"%appdata%/LOVE/SuperSprite/export"
- Files you wish to import must be placed in:
> "%appdata%/LOVE/SuperSprite/import"

In the applications current state only supports frames that are 16x16. If you don't follow this the application WILL crash.
